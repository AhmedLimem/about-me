# hello-world
Hello World ! This is my first repository to get start with GitHub.

Hi Humans !

Overall, I am a Futuristic Maker crazy about Technology who dreams of great things and works hard to achieve them.

In more realistic terms, I'm an enthusiastic and persevering future-engineer doing my best to merge my academic training and professional experience to strive for excellence. I am particularly passionate about working on cutting edge Tech by designing smart, autonomous and connected systems.
