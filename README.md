Hi Humans !

Overall, I am a Futuristic Maker crazy about Technology who dreams of great things and works hard to achieve them.

In more realistic terms, I'm an enthusiastic and persevering future-engineer doing my best to merge my academic training and professional experience to strive for excellence. I am particularly passionate about working on cutting edge Tech by designing smart, autonomous and connected systems.

More precisely, I'm an Electrical Engineering student with a specialization in Automation and Systems Design at the National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT). In parallel, I am pursuing a Research Master in Data Processing in Sound and Vision Perception in co-graduation with Paris Descartes University - France.

As an application of my academic background, I'm currently an Intern in Robotic Systems Integration in Industry of the Future at AIP-PRIMECA cluster within Paul Sabatier University - Toulouse and previously trainee in building open-source autonomous machines for digital manufacturing at OpenLab Hambourg - Germany and former Projects Manager at Fablab ENIT. I forgot to mention that I participated in the organization of the International Conference of Fablabs FAB14.
To sum up, I'm an active member integrating the Open-source and Fablabs community.

For my future, I see myself in a career where I will be able to work on cutting edge technology.
